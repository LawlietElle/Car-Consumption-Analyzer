# Car-Consumption-Analyzer
Script to analyze csv files from ObdII devices and plot consumption. Developed to gather all the data from every group
for the "Trasporti e mobilit√† sostenibile" course of the Politecnico of Turin for "Talented students". 

#### Note:
the classes are very general and work for a single csv file on any OS. The "main" script is specific for the course's purpose
handling the exception we encountered and only works on Debian based distros.
